# Creating the environment "YOU" need

## Some Context to my thoughts.
As shopify partners we have a built in expectation that we shoul have the tools and flows given to us verbatim to achieve our development goals. No matter if it is building apps, themes or anything else amazing we can dream up. So often this spouts out as "Shopify please give us X tool" when we recieve X it never matches the needs expecation. 

This is unfortunatley the case in all dev communities, oppinionated structures and scaffholding will appease many but it is not neccessarily "What" you need or what will make you are your company more performant. Worst of all some times following an oppinionated flow which is out side of your teams mindset can detrimentally slow or cripple your team. 

With all that as a bit of context and based from a number of years around the edges in a number of agencies and workflows. After multiple iterations, multiple failures, managing developers / engineers at all levels. I have come to stong belief, that a team or agency should build and adopt their tooling. This can be a great opportunity to unify a team and remove knowledge silos surrounding the core tools that are in use from a day to day perspective. 

Now I am not saying go out there and write a language, optimizer etc etc. I am talking about composing a collection made up amazing tools that this phenomenal OSS community has shaped the face of the web with. Tweak them to your needs, understand them and most of all iterate constantly. Learn and watch the industry and adopt salient approaches as a team growing your base from project to project.

## A sanity check from experience
Never be afraid to abandon something or make a change if something doesnt work for your team, failure is just a step to better processes. Embrace that mindset and you will be happier.
